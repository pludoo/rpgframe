RPGframe is a framework to establish RPG type games, as of now
features include's these systems:
Player & NPC Systems,
Questing System,
Inventory Management (seperate Pet & Item inventories),
and Pet Management.
-- A few extra notes -- 
Items' only contain a couple variables, a name and description. To create custom items that have custom functions,
make a new class that is derived from Item in item.py or create a standalone class entirely.

Feel free to change the code how you want, this is just a starting platform, so let your creativity free :).
